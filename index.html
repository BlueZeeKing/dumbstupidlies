        <h2>Lie 1</h2>
        <p>100 years ago chairs had wings and they would soar around in the sky like birds, and then the table came along. The table was annoyed that the chairs got to fly so one day it trapped them and cut off their wings. Now chairs are tables servants. The end</p>
        <h2>Lie 2</h2>
        <p>On the night of your fifteenth birthday, if you walk outside and stand in the moonlight(if there is a new moon you are screwed) then the next day, at twelve pm, you'll be able to read peoples minds for exactly one hour. However, if you stand in the moonlight after 10:56 pm on the night of your fifteenth birthday, then you will turn into a light bulb the next day at twelve pm.</p>
