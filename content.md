## Lie 1 - Chairs

100 years ago chairs had wings and they would soar around in the sky like birds, and then the table came along. The table was annoyed that the chairs got to fly so one day it trapped them and cut off their wings. Now chairs are tables servants. The end

## Lie 2 - Birthdays

On the night of your fifteenth birthday, if you walk outside and stand in the moonlight(if there is a new moon you are screwed) then the next day, at twelve pm, you'll be able to read peoples minds for exactly one hour. However, if you stand in the moonlight after 10:56 pm on the night of your fifteenth birthday, then you will turn into a light bulb the next day at twelve pm.

## Lie 3 - Notebooks and Guitars

Notebooks have secret identities! They are actually also guitars. I know, truly shocking. You see, long long ago notebooks played this really fun video game. In it, you got to choose your favorite guitar character to be and battle the other guitars. The notebooks enjoyed it so much, that one day their leader decided to call the wizard. Billy Bob Joe. Billy Bob Joe separated the notebooks into two groups. One group he turned into guitars, and the other group stayed as notebooks. The group of notebooks that didn't become a guitar was sad, but no worries! They still got to play their fun video game!

## Lie 4 - Dresses

Dresses! Many people think they look lovely, but today you will learn the truth! Dresses are actually evil monsters. To you, your appearance seems lovely. But to everyone else you look hideous! The dress makes you hear compliments but really people are insulting you. Never wear a dress again!

## Lie 5 - The Disease

If a polar bear bites you on a new moon, you get an incurable disease called *Dumb Stupid Lie Disease*. There is no cure and will never go away. It causes no other symptoms except if you go into an environment above 50 degrees you immediately die, unless you wear a wetsuit for at least 72 hours before going into the room. You must also wear a tinfoil hat for a week.
